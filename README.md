## Building from Source

Packaging will create builds in the dist/ folder

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, if you run the test script, you will get test errors about venmic, you can ignore these as it's a linux only module.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Equicord/Equibop
cd Equibop

# Install Dependencies
pnpm i

# Either run it without packaging
pnpm start

# Or package
pnpm package

# Or only build the pacman target
pnpm package --linux pacman

# Or package to a directory only
pnpm package:dir
```
